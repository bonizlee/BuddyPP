# Buddy++

Buddy++ is an open source Arduino IDE developed based on the Java FX framework. BuddyPP is more beautiful and convenient than the official IDE. We designed many features for zero base developers. We have added a user-friendly interactive programming mechanism in BuddyPP. Developers can generate code in the setting window without the need to keep in mind all sorts of boring keywords, data types, and grammatical structures.
